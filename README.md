# Simulations for the Paper **Cascaded Multiwire-PLC/Multiple-VLC System: Characterization and Performance**

This repository contains the code and simulations used to generate the results presented in the paper **Joint Power Control and Beam Steering for NGSO-to-GSO Interference Mitigation in Ku Band**. The figures and data shown in the paper are reproduced using a Jupyter notebook **simulations.ipynb** that calls functions and classes defined in a custom Python package called **epfd_analysis**.

## How to Run

1. Clone this repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/HigoTh/kuepfd.git
   cd your-repository
   ```

2. (Optional) Create and activate a virtual environment:

   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate   # Linux/Mac
   .\venv\Scripts\activate    # Windows
   ```

3. Install the required dependencies (if available):

   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

   > Note: If there is no `requirements.txt` file, make sure you have installed libraries such as `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `scipy`, and others used in the notebook.

4. Run the `simulations.ipynb` notebook:

   You can open the notebook with Jupyter:

   ```bash
   jupyter notebook paper_simulations.ipynb
   ```

## About the `mplcvlc` Package

The `kuepfd/` folder contains a Python package with helper implementations used in the notebook, including functions for modeling and data generation.

Make sure the current directory is included in `PYTHONPATH`, or that you are running the notebook from the root of the repository, so that Python can correctly import the package.

## Results

The results generated by the notebook are automatically saved in the `results/` folder. This folder may contain images, .txt files, or other intermediate data used in the analyses and figures.
